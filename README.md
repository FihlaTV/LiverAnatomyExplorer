# LiverAnatomyExplorer

The WebGL LiverAnatomyExplorer has been developed in a german research project supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research ("BMBF"). Our goal was the development of a new medical e-learning application. In contrast to existing e-learning portals, we provide interactive web-based 3D models derived from anonymized clinical data. The 3D visualizations are accessible in real-time with our newly developed 3D viewer based on X3D, [X3DOM](https://github.com/x3dom/x3dom) and WebGL. No platform-speciÔ¨Åc browser plugin is required!
